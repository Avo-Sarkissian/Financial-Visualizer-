# Financial-Visualizer-

This project aims to develop a financial visualization software that not only simplifies the process of analyzing complex financial data but also provides users with powerful projection tools such as graphs and charts. By utilizing historical data, the software will enable users to forecast future financial trends, making it a valuable tool for people trying to keep track of their personal finances. 
The software will begin with a user interface allowing the user to select from a list of options of how they can utilize the software. The user will also be able to input personal data of their financials, in order to budget their spending vs saving/investing. Some goals for this project are for the program to allow users to calculate loan/debt pay off time based on interest and compare if it is more effective to spend money on paying back a loan sooner vs investing into the stock market. Additionally, this project will use charts and graphs to help the user visualize and better understand their financial standing.
	In order to use this program, the user should install the following libraries: Pandas, Numpy, and Statsmodel, which are powerful libraries that allow the program to use its expansive features. 
	


Installing Pandas
Pandas is an open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

Open your command line interface (CLI):
Windows: Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
MacOS/Linux: Open Terminal.
Execute the following command:
pip install pandas
This command downloads and installs the latest version of Pandas and its dependencies.
Installing NumPy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

In the same CLI window, execute the following command:

pip install numpy
Just like with Pandas, this command will download and install the latest version of NumPy.
Installing StatsModels
StatsModels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. It's an excellent tool for the statistical analysis of financial data.

In the CLI, execute the following command:

pip install statsmodels
This will install StatsModels along with any missing dependencies.
Verifying the Installation
After installing Pandas, NumPy, and StatsModels, you can verify the installation by trying to import them in a Python interpreter session.

Open the Python interpreter by typing python in your CLI.
Try importing the libraries with the following commands:
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
If you don't get any errors, the libraries are installed correctly.
